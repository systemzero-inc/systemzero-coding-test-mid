# System Zero Engineering Coding Test

Welcome to the System Zero engineering coding test! This project evaluates your engineering approach, system design decisions, and code quality through focused implementation tasks.

## Important Notes

- This is NOT a task to build a complete end-to-end platform
- Pre-coding before the interview is not permitted
- You may explore the codebase after receiving access
- The goal is to understand your engineering thought process and decision-making

## What You Will Be Doing?

During this 60 minute technical interview, you will:

1. Implement specific features in a pair programming session with the interviewer
2. Handle streaming data and build API endpoints
3. Make architectural and design decisions along the way

Important Guidelines:
- Clearly communicate your thought process and reasoning behind technical decisions
- Feel free to ask questions and discuss approaches with the interviewer
- The interviewer will provide guidance if needed and may ask questions about your choices
- This is meant to be collaborative - treat it as working with a colleague

The interviewer will act as both an observer and a helpful resource. They will:
- Guide you through the requirements
- Answer any questions you have
- Provide technical assistance if needed
- Ask questions about your implementation choices
- Help keep track of time and scope

Remember: The goal is not just to complete the tasks, but to demonstrate your problem-solving approach, communication skills, and engineering mindset. Take your time to explain your decisions and don't hesitate to think out loud.

## What We Evaluate

- Clean, maintainable code structure
- System design and architectural choices
- Testing and error handling approaches
- Clear communication of technical decisions
- Problem-solving methodology

During the interview, you'll work on specific implementation tasks focusing on:
- LLM agent integration
- Streaming data handling
- API and middleware development
- Database modeling
- Testing strategies

## Getting Started

To run the project in development mode, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ~v23
- Docker and Docker Compose
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Setup Database
The project uses PostgreSQL running in Docker. Start it with:

```ssh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Setup API
To setup the API, run

```sh
pnpm i
```

```sh
pnpm prisma generate
```

In the /api folder create a .env file with the following content:
```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/systemzero?schema=public
OPENAI_API_KEY=<INSERT_API_KEY_SHARED_BY_SZ_TEAM>
```

Run a database migration
```sh
pnpm dlx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
``` 

To start the API server, run
```sh
pnpm start:dev
```

### Setup APP
To setup the APP, run 

```sh
pnpm i
```

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Evaluation Criteria

You'll be evaluated on:
- Code quality and organization
- System design decisions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Documentation and clarity
- Performance considerations
